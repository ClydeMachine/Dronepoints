# Dronepoints
Create Points and have them move through a defined environment, like drones flying in a box!

A "Point" is defined as an object with an x, y, and z coordinate. The Point is then assigned a velocity with which it will move through a three-dimensional space. The space can be a shape other than a simple cube, such as a pyramid or sphere. Collisions with edges of the finite space environment will produce a bouncing-off behaviour for the Point that strikes it.

Points will also have modules attached to them, which can affect how they interact with boundaries or other Points, including trading modules upon collision.
